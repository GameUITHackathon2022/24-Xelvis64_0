## About the game
**Game title:** Green Constitution

**Game description:** You shall be the supreme leader of a country named Evironnation. Your country is facing multiple problems including environmental protection, resource management, etc... As the person with the highest authority, make the wisest decisions possible as poorly calculated ones can lead to dangerous outcome for your nation.
## Development process
After spending the first and a half hour to discuss the idea we want to go with for the theme "Environmental protection", we chose "Green Constitution" as the game we want to make in the next 22.5 hours.

Here are the tools we used:
 - **Unity** (version 2021.3.14f1) for core game development as well as playtesting
 - **Visual Studio 2021** for scripting
 - **Figma** for UI/UX design
 - **Google Drive** for file sharing
 - **GitHub** for version control
 - **Adobe Premier** for editing music and sound effect (it's chosen because of its availability not usability)
## How to play
All you have to do to play our game is cloning this repository, open it in your Unity editor and go to TestSwipe\Assets\MainMenu\Scenes then click MenuScene to play the game. 

Due to calling APIs when running scripts, the game can take some time to boot.

A full build of the game is planned for the near future.
## Quick guide for playing the game
You have 4 indexes you need to pay attention to which are **Economy**, **Happiness**, **Pollution level** and **Resource**. Each of them has a starting value of 50, the maximum of which are 100 and you will lose if any of them  drops down to 0 except for **Pollution level** which is the opposite.

Each card shown to you will either be an event or problem you need to take of as leader. Respond to these cards by swiping left or right as in "No" or "Yes" respectively. Responses you make will affect the four indexes mentioned above in a positive or negative way. Respond cleverly to keep your indexes at a stable level until the end of the game and you are victorious!
